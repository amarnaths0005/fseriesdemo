Fourier Series Magnitude and Phase Spectra Demo

Computes the displays the Fourier Series Magnitude and Phase Spectra for these four waveforms: Square Wave, Triangular Wave, Sawtooth Wave, and Full Wave Rectified Sine Wave.

Functionality: 
1. Should allow the user to choose from these signal types - Square, Triangle, 
    Ramp or Sawtooth, Full wave rectified sine. Default Square wave.
2. Should allow the user to choose the period of the signal over the range 5 to 25 in 
    steps of 0.1. Default period 10.
3. Should allow the user to choose the number of Fourier Coefficients from 1 to 15.
    Default should be 5.
4. Should display the waveform of the original signal, in blue, and the 
    reconstructed waveform after Fourier Synthesis, in red.
5. Should allow the user the user to view the error between the original and 
    reconstructed signal, a radio button to view the error, or view the signals.
6. Should show the magnitude spectrum, as a lollipop plot. Should have a radio button
    to see the frequency or Fourier coefficient on the x-axis.
7. Should show the phase spectrum, as a lollipop plot. Again, should have a radio button
    to see the frequency or Fourier coefficient on the x-axis.
